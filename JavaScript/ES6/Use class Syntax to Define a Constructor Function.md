ES6 provides a new syntax to create objects, using the class keyword.

It should be noted that the `class` syntax is just syntax,
 and not a full-fledged class-based implementation of an object-oriented
 paradigm, unlike in languages such as Java, Python, Ruby, etc.

In ES5, we usually define a `constructor` function and use the `new` keyword to instantiate an object.

```jsx
var SpaceShuttle = function(targetPlanet){
  this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
}
var zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
```

The `class` syntax simply replaces the `constructor` function creation:

```jsx
class SpaceShuttle {
  constructor(targetPlanet) {
    this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
  }
}
const zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
```

> It should be noted that the `class` keyword declares a new function, to which a constructor is added. This constructor is invoked when `new` is called to create a new object.
> 

**Note:** UpperCamelCase should be used by convention for ES6 class names, as in `SpaceShuttle` used above.

The `constructor` method is a special method for creating 
and initializing an object created with a class. You will learn more 
about it in the Object Oriented Programming section of the JavaScript 
Algorithms And Data Structures Certification.

Use the `class` keyword and write a `constructor` to create the `Vegetable` class.

The `Vegetable` class allows you to create a vegetable object with a property `name` that gets passed to the `constructor`.

```jsx
var SpaceShuttle = function(targetPlanet){
  this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
}
var zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
-----
class SpaceShuttle {
  constructor(targetPlanet) {
    this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
  }
}
const zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
```

```jsx
class Vegetable {
  constructor(name){
      this.name = name;
  }
}

const carrot = new Vegetable('carrot');
console.log(carrot.name); // Should display 'carrot'
```
